## *AccessiScan*

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for the development of a Web Accessibility Checker and Improver Tool. This tool aims to assist web developers in ensuring their websites comply with accessibility standards, specifically the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), thereby making the internet more inclusive and accessible to individuals with disabilities.

#### 1.2 Scope
The software will provide automated checks, suggestions for improvements, educational resources, and real-time assistance to help developers create accessible websites. It will include features for checking compliance, generating reports, suggesting fixes, and monitoring accessibility over time.

#### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **WCAG**: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
- **UI**: User Interface
- **UX**: User Experience
- **ARIA**: Accessible Rich Internet Applications
- **API**: Application Programming Interface
- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment

### 2. Overall Description

#### 2.1 Product Perspective
The Web Accessibility Checker and Improver Tool will be a standalone web application that integrates with existing web development environments and tools. It will provide APIs for integration into CI/CD pipelines and support multiple browsers for accessibility testing.

#### 2.2 Product Functions
- Automated scanning of web pages to identify accessibility issues.
- Evaluation of websites against WCAG standards (2.0, 2.1, and future versions).
- Generation of detailed accessibility reports categorized by severity.
- Provision of actionable suggestions and code snippets to fix accessibility issues.
- Real-time feedback and guidance during the development process.
- Educational resources including tutorials, articles, and videos on accessibility best practices.
- Compliance dashboard for monitoring accessibility status and improvements.

#### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- **Developers**: Users who build and maintain websites and web applications.
- **Accessibility Specialists**: Users who specialize in accessibility testing and compliance.
- **Administrators**: Users who manage settings, users, and API integrations within the tool.

#### 2.4 Operating Environment
- The tool will operate as a web application accessible via modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- Backend services will be hosted on a scalable cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure) to ensure reliability and performance.

#### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- The tool must comply with WCAG standards itself to ensure accessibility for users with disabilities.
- It should be scalable to handle large volumes of website scans and user interactions concurrently.
- Integration APIs should be well-documented and easy to implement for developers.

#### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Assumption: Users have basic knowledge of web development principles and WCAG guidelines.
- Dependency: Availability of third-party accessibility testing libraries and APIs for automated scanning.
